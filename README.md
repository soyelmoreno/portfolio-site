# Carlos Moreno's Portfolio

[cmoreno.me](http://cmoreno.me) will hold my portfolio of various frontend and full stack projects.

There will be different subdomains with live sites for each project.

- [hello.cmoreno.me](http://hello.cmoreno.me): simple Express app serving "Hello
  World". There's also a basic chatbot app (from the Frontend Masters course
  "Full Stack for Frontend v2).
- [book.cmoreno.me](http://book.cmoreno.me): small Express app for managing a
  list of books. Based on a tutorial article: [Building a REST API with Node and
  Express](https://stackabuse.com/building-a-rest-api-with-node-and-express/)

Eventually, I'll add styling and layout to the main site, and blocks
representing each project. For now, the main site is a list of links to each
project.
